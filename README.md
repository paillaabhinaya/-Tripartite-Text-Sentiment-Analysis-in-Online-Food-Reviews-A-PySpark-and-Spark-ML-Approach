This project focuses on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset,a rich repository of customer feedback on a diverse range of food products. Comprising ~500,000 reviews, this data setpresents a unique opportunity to explore consumer sentimentsin the food sector. It offers the complexity and volume necessary to test and refine sentiment analysis models effectively.At the core of our analysis lies Apache Spark, a powerfuldistributed computing system renowned for its ability to handle large-scale data processing. Leveraging the PySpark interface,this project harnesses Spark's robust capabilities to manage and
analyze extensive data from Amazon reviews. This framework is particularly suited for this task due to its efficiency in processing large datasets and its sophisticated machine learning libraries.Our methodology encompasses utilizing machine learning techniques to classify reviews into distinct sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. This classification not only aids in understanding consumer attitudes but also demonstrates the practical application of big data tools in extracting meaningful patterns from complex datasets.The objectives of this project are multifaceted: to showcase the effectiveness of PySpark in big data sentiment analysis, to provide insights into customer opinions in the food industry, and to explore the nuances of sentiment classification using advanced computational techniques. By navigating these
objectives, the project aims to contribute to the growing field of sentiment analysis and offer valuable perspectives for businesses leveraging customer review data.Through this endeavor, we anticipate uncovering detailed insights into consumer sentiment trends, thereby offering a model which can be modified for analogous studies in different contexts. This project stands as a testament to the evolving landscape of big data analytics and its pivotal role in understanding and utilizing customer feedback in the digital era.

Goals and objectives are as follows:

• Construct an analytical model designed to process a substantial corpus of textual data, emphasizing scalability to adapt to increasing data volumes while maintaining computational efficiency, reflecting an advanced application of big data analytics.
• Attain a good level of accuracy in categorizing consumer reviews into defined sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral), underscoring the model's ability to discern intricate sentiment nuances inherent in consumer feedback.
• Systematically evaluate and contrast various machine learning algorithms within the Spark ML library, with an emphasis on identifying the most effective model for sentiment analysis in large datasets.
